intensity_analysis using NLP and DL

**Overview**
This repository contains code for performing intensity analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning techniques. Intensity analysis is the process of determining the intensity or strength of sentiment expressed in textual data.The primary goal of this project is to provide a framework for analyzing the intensity of sentiment in text data, which can be useful in various applications such as sentiment analysis, opinion mining, and social media monitoring.

**Features**
Utilizes NLP techniques for text preprocessing, tokenization, and feature extraction.
Implements deep learning models for sentiment analysis and intensity estimation.
Provides tools for visualizing the intensity distribution of sentiment in text data.
Supports both supervised and unsupervised intensity analysis approaches.

**Usage**
Data Preparation:
Prepare your text data in a suitable format. Each data point should ideally contain a text string.
Split your data into training, validation, and test sets if you're using supervised learning.
Preprocessing:
Preprocess your text data using the provided preprocessing scripts.
Tokenize the text and convert it into a suitable format for model input.
Model Training:
Train your intensity analysis model using the provided scripts.
Experiment with different deep learning architectures and hyperparameters to optimize performance.
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the trained model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Analyze the intensity distribution of sentiment in your dataset using visualization tools.
Inference:
Use the trained model to predict the intensity of sentiment in new text data.
Analyze the results and interpret the intensity of sentiment expressed in the text.
